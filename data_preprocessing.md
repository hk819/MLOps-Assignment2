# Data Preprocessing Steps

## Introduction:
Data preprocessing is an essential step in any data analysis or machine learning project. In this document, we outline the steps involved in preprocessing the data for our project.

## Steps:
1. **Cleaning and Formatting:**
   - We cleaned and formatted the text data extracted from websites to remove any noise or irrelevant information.
   - Special characters, extra whitespaces, and other inconsistencies were removed to ensure clean data.

2. **Text Normalization:**
   - Text normalization techniques, such as converting text to lowercase, were applied to ensure consistency in the data.

## Techniques Used:
- We utilized Python's regular expressions (regex) library for cleaning and formatting text data.
- Text normalization was performed using simple string manipulation techniques.

## Challenges Faced:
- One challenge we encountered was handling inconsistent formatting across different sources of data.
- To address this challenge, we implemented robust cleaning and normalization techniques to standardize the data format.
