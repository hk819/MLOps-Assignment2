# Data Preprocessing Steps

## Introduction
Data preprocessing is a fundamental phase in any data analysis or machine learning endeavor. This document delineates the procedural steps involved in preparing our project's data.

## Steps
1. **Cleaning and Formatting:**
   - The text data extracted from websites underwent meticulous cleaning and formatting to eliminate noise and extraneous information.
   - Special characters, excess whitespaces, and other irregularities were systematically removed to ensure data purity.

2. **Text Normalization:**
   - Techniques for text normalization, such as converting text to lowercase, were applied to promote uniformity within the dataset.

## Techniques Utilized
- Cleaning and formatting of text data were executed leveraging Python's regex library.
- Text normalization was facilitated through straightforward string manipulation techniques.

## Challenges Encountered
- An obstacle we faced involved managing inconsistent data formatting across disparate sources.
- To surmount this challenge, we implemented robust cleaning and normalization methodologies to standardize the data structure.
